## Product description
The Pillow Partner is a product that aims to simulate the intimacy of a couple
over long distances with the use of a pillow that simulates the heartbeat of
your partner, while also heating up to match the body temperature.

The system is composed of four components:
    * The pillow, which includes vibration motors, a heat pad and communication
    electronics.
    * The watch, which is used to gather heartbeat and temperature data.
    * The phone app, which facilitates the transfer of data between the pillow,
    the watch and the partner.
    * The exchange server, which handles the data transfer between partners.
